# notagain_rm -rf
**Did you just ```rm -rf``` a file or directory you weren't supposed to ? Couple quick scripts to save the day :)**
```
notagain_yn.sh 
```

It asks for reconfirmation, if you want to delete, while no other commands are filtered and executed as it is.
```

notagain_timed.sh
```

It waits 6sec , giving you ample time for ^C if you want to abort.
